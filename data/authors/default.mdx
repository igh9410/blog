Hi! I'm Geonhyuk Im, a software engineer both capable of frontend and backend, but more interested in backend and cloud computing.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, minor in Applied Mathematics from Purdue University Northwest, graduated in May 2021.

My last experience at IPIN LABS, an deep-learning based indoor position tracking SaaS company, was leading the migration of the company's indoor location tracking

software's frontend. I spearheaded the transition of the frontend from Python Django Template

to React TypeScript. The previous Python Django Template frontend project was hardly

modularized, so when I set up the new React TypeScript frontend project, I planned andexecuted the folder structure to maximize the modularity and reusability of each component.

I also dealt with backend and infrastructure. I helped adding documentations to previous project, BPIN, using Swagger and OpenAPI.

I also practiced how to monitor and deploy the company's web application to AWS, features including Elastic BeanStalk, S3, RDS, Application LoadBalancers, ElasticCache and Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka.
