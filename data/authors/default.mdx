Hi, I'm Geonhyuk (Jack) Im â€” a DevOps & Backend Engineer with a strong interest in cloud-native infrastructure and automation.

I enjoy building scalable, maintainable systems using tools like Terraform, Helm, and ArgoCD. My main focus is on automating deployments, improving observability, and managing cloud resources with Infrastructure as Code. I typically work with AWS, Kubernetes, and Go, and use CI/CD pipelines to streamline delivery processes.

I have hands-on experience setting up GitOps pipelines, monitoring stacks with Prometheus and Grafana, and configuring secure, production-grade cloud environments. In my spare time, I like working on side projects where I can explore new tools, refine my workflows, and document the things I learn along the way.

This blog is a place where I share my thoughts and experiences in backend engineering, DevOps, and cloud infrastructure.
