# Building a GitOps Pipeline with ArgoCD on GKE using Terraform and Helm - Part 1

In this blog post, I will share my approach to building a GitOps pipeline with GitHub Actions and ArgoCD on GKE using Terraform and Helm.

## Prerequisites

- A GCP project
- Two GitHub repositories (one for the application code and one for the infrastructure code)

## Overview

I want to introduce a GitOps pipeline to the existing application codebase with Kubernetes deployments.
The piepeline looks like the below diagram:

So basically, the pipeline will be triggered by a push to the `main` branch of the application repository.
Then GitHub Actions will build the application and push the application Docker image to the GCP Artifact Registry.
Then ArgoCD Image Updater will detect the new image and create a new commit to the `main` branch of the infrastructure repository, updating the deployment with the new image.
Finally, ArgoCD periodically syncs the changes to the GKE cluster, updating the deployment with the new image.
