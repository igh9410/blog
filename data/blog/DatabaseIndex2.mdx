# Hash Indexing, SS Table, LSM Tree

Hash indexing is a common data structure used for indexing in NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra. It is a key-value store that uses a hash function to map keys to values, allowing for quick lookups in constant time.<br/>
Hash indexing is particularly useful for queries that filter on a single key, as it provides fast access to the corresponding value.<br/>
Key difference between hash indexing and B-Tree indexing is that hash indexing does not maintain the sorted order of the keys, which can be a limitation for range queries or sorting operations.<br/>
Hash table has limitations that it all saves the data in-memory, leading to storage limitation when there are too many keys. This leads to random I/O, expensive disk expansion costs and needs additional logic to handle hash collisions.<br/>
To enhance the performance of hash indexing, MongoDB and Cassandra use additional data structures such as SS-Tables and LSM-Trees.

## SS Table (Sorted String Table)

SS-Table is a data structure used in NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra to store key-value pairs in sorted order. It is a disk-based data structure that allows for efficient range queries and sorting operations.
While hash indexing does not maintain the sorted order of the keys and saves all the data including old data, SS-Table stores the data in sorted order and only saves the latest version of each key. <br/>
This allows for quick lookups and range queries, as the database engine can quickly locate the desired keys based on their position in the SS-Table.
Segmented storage doesn't have fixed size while B-Tree has fixed size (4KB), and it is more efficient for range queries and sorting operations. <br/>

## LSM Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree)

LSM Tree is a data structure used in NoSQL databases such as Cassandra to optimize write performance and reduce disk I/O. It is a disk-based data structure that combines the benefits of both B-Tree and SS-Table.
SS Table has limitations that if the key doesn't exist in the SS Table, it needs to check the memtable and other SS Tables (Older segmentations)<br/>
To optimize this kind of approach, database engines use Bloom Filter to check if the key exists in the SS Table or not.<br/>
There are many different strategies to merge the SS Tables, but most widely used are size-tiered compaction, and leveled compaction<br/>
Size-tiered compaction merges SS Tables based on the size of the tables, which is merging new SS Tables with the old SS Tables.<br/>
Leveled compaction merges SS Tables based on the level of the tables. It divides the key range into smaller SS-Tables and move older data to independent levels. And as long as
the data is sorted, it can execute range query more efficiently.<br/>
LSM Tree's basic idea is to merge SS Tables in the background to reduce the number of disk I/O operations and improve read performance.<br/>
LSM Tree is optimized for write-heavy workloads, as it allows for efficient write operations by buffering data in memory before flushing it to disk in a sequential manner.<br/>
