# Introduction to gRPC

In gRPC, a client application can directly call methods on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easier to create distributed applications and services.  
gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, load balancing, and bidirectional streaming.  
gRPC is based on the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. On the server side,
the server implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls. On the client side, the client has a stub that provides the same methods as the server.  
gRPC clients and servers can be implemented in multiple languages, making it easy to create interoperable services across different platforms.
For example, a client written in Go can call a server written in Java, and vice versa.

## Protocol Buffers

By default, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers as the interface description language. Protocol Buffers is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.

The first step to using Protocol Buffers is to define the structure of the data you want to serialize in a `.proto` file.
For example, the following `.proto` file defines a simple message with a single field:

```protobuf
message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 id = 2;
  bool has_ponycopter = 3;
}
```

Starting from a service definition in a .proto file, gRPC provides protocol buffer compiler plugins that generate client- and server-side code. gRPC users typically call these APIs on the client side and implement the corresponding API on the server side.

On the server side, the server implements the methods declared by the service and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls. The gRPC infrastructure decodes incoming requests, executes service methods, and encodes service responses.  
On the client side, the client has a stub that provides the same methods as the server. The client can call these methods directly, as if they were local methods.
So both client and server define a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types.
