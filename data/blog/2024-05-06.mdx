# Introduction

In this blog post, we will discuss how to enhance the architecture of a chat application
by migrating the server to a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform.

## Previous Architecture

Blabber-Hive is a chat application that allows users to communicate with each other in real time.
It's a simple chat application in which users can create chat rooms, join chat rooms,
and send messages to each other.
Frontend is SPA (Single-Page Application) built with React TypeScript, bundled with Vite,
and hosted on Cloudflare pages.
The backend is built with the Golang Gin framework, dockerized,
and hosted on Fly.io. And I use Supabase only for authentication and authorization.
The database is PostgreSQL, hosted on Fly.io as well. There's a Redis server for caching,
and Kafka cluster for batch-inserting chat messages to Postgres.
The overall architecture is shown below:
